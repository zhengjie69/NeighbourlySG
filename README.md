<h1>NeighbourlySG</h1>
In an increasingly interconnected world, fostering community engagement and enhancing local connectivity are vital components of urban living. 
Despite Singaporeâ€™s urban density and the presence of diverse communities, many residents still feel disconnected from their immediate surroundings. 
Due to the pandemic in 2019, it is reported that youths in Singapore are more likely to report higher levels of social isolation and loneliness as 
they missed the opportunity to socialise with people while transiting to the different stages of life. This disconnection can lead to a 
sense of isolation, missed opportunities for collaboration and a lack of collective action in addressing community issues.

<br>
NeighbourlySG aims to address these challenges by offering a digital solution that is designed to foster community connectivity and enhance neighbourhood 
social cohesion across Singapore. Serving as a centralised hub, NeighbourlySG empowers residents to build meaningful local connections, organise and participate 
in community activities, share vital information, and contribute to neighbourhood safety and well-being. By providing this platform, NeighbourlySG aims to increase 
community engagement and encourage active participation among residents, thereby enabling them to play a pivotal role in shaping and enhancing their local environment.
